		<p>Lemongrass is an herb with a citrus twist -- hence its name! It is often used in Asian cuisine and will give your dish a zesty kick. Lemongrass oil also has many interesting uses, such as preservative, pesticide, antifungal, medicine, and insect repellant.</p>
		<p>We source our lemongrass directly from South Asia and Southeast Asia. Our lemongrass is of the highest quality and freshness.</p>
